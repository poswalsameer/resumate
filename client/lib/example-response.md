The layout is professional and easy to scan, with the level of seniority (entry-level to junior) clearly indicated through the mix of professional experience, projects, and education.",
    "tone_check": "Confident and active. The resume uses strong action verbs like 'Engineered,' 'Architected,' and 'Migrated' that convey proactivity and ownership."

  "2_quantifying_impact": {
    "status": "Moderate",
    "feedback": "The resume contains several well-quantified achievements (4x speed, 25% revenue increase, 30% performance improvement) which effectively demonstrate impact. However, many bullet points lack specific metrics that would strengthen the claims.",
    "missing_opportunities": "The bullet point about 'Collaborating with the backend team to ship code with higher accuracy' could be quantified with specific error reduction percentages. The PR review contributions could quantify the number of reviews conducted or the impact of those reviews. The project descriptions could include user metrics, traffic numbers, or adoption rates."

Add a dedicated 'Skills' section that categorizes technologies (e.g., Frontend Frameworks, Styling, Backend Technologies, Tools) to make parsing easier. Include 'responsive design' and 'accessibility' as they were specifically mentioned in the job description."

    "closing_summary": "You have a solid technical foundation that makes you a competitive candidate for frontend engineering roles. To increase your interview callback rate, focus on: 1) Adding a professional summary at the top that directly addresses the job requirements, 2) Quantify every achievement where possible, even if it's estimating numbers, 3) Replace weaker verbs with more powerful alternatives, 4) Explicitly mention 'responsive design' and 'accessibility' in your skills or experience, and 5) Add one bullet point that demonstrates leadership or communication skills. With these tweaks, your resume will be much more compelling to both recruiters and hiring managers."
